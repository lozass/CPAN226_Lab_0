# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

This project currently has no source files, documentation, or established conventions. As the codebase evolves, update this file to reflect:

- The overall architecture and purpose of the project
- Key developer workflows (build, test, debug) and any non-obvious commands
- Project-specific conventions, naming patterns, or directory structures
- Integration points, external dependencies, and communication patterns
- References to files or directories that exemplify important patterns

## Getting Started
- There are no files in the repository yet. Add a README.md and initial source files to establish project structure and conventions.
- Once code is present, document any unique or non-standard practices here to help AI agents and developers onboard quickly.

## Example Section (to update as code is added)
- **Main entry point:** _TBD_
- **Build command:** _TBD_
- **Test command:** _TBD_
- **Key directories:** _TBD_

_Keep this file concise and actionable. Update as the project grows._
